# style-diffusion
This project's theme is to manipulate the style of images generated by a pre-trained denoising
diffusion model using a mechanism called classifier guidance.

This task is comprised of two main components:
* A module that computes the style loss of an image (given a style reference image). 
  The style loss computation is done by following the Neural Style-transfer algorithm by Gatys et al.
* A denoising diffusion-based image generator

The first part of the project modifies the style-transfer algorithm to perform feature inversion, text synthesis and using a different style loss.

## Feature Inversion
Modifying the neural style transfer algorithm to invert features from different stages of the
VGG-19 network, we get the following results:
